## Task 1 — Correlation from Online Graph (10 pts)

**Source:** The exam page shows blue points; their coordinates appear on hover.  
Because the page only displays a chart (not a raw dataset), I manually read each point by hovering and recorded them in code.

### Data (manually read from the online graph)
```text
(-5, -5), (-5, 2), (-3, -1), (-1, 1),
(1, -2), (3, 1), (5, -3), (7, -2)
